# ZF_FPC
 
 ImageJ / Fiji Macro based on fluorescent pixel count which can be used to quantify "growth" by increase of flourescent signal e.g. due to multiplication of fluorescent xenotransplanted cancer cells or fluorescent bacteria in zebrafish larvae. It will export a report file containing the data, an extensive log file and QC images in user defined folders. 
  Optionally variables and parameters can be adjusted by dialogues for adaption to new sample types, a batch mode is available.
  A detection background slider can be added in the future - see commented functions ("//for later addition").
